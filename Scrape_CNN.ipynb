On one hand, economists at the University of Massachusetts believe large-scale investment in clean energy would create aboutOn the other hand, expanding development of oil and natural gas resources would create 1.1 million jobs and $127 billion in government revenue by 2020,Those numbers could benefit the nation's budget and some of America's 14 million unemployed.Charles T. Drevna of the National Petrochemical & Refiners Association summed up his stance in an editorial for the Washington political web site,: \"It's time for America to develop an energy policy based on reality rather than ideology, grounded in what works rather than in hopes and dreams.\"As political pressure rises inside the White House to slash unemployment, Courtney Hight -- a former member of the-- says she doubts now whether President Obama is \"seeing the opportunity for job growth within some of these clean energy standards and policies.\"Defending Obama's environmental record, White House spokesman Clark Stevens pledged the administration \"will continue to take steps to meet the president's important goals of protecting the health of our families, increasing our nation's clean energy generation, reducing our reliance on foreign oil, and supporting American industries and innovation.\"Criticism of Obama's clean energy initiatives resulted inthis week after solar panel maker Solyndra -- which got about a half billion dollars in federal loan guarantees -- went bankrupt. On Thursday, because they're  \"part of that package of technologies of the future that have to be based here in the United States.\" The president said Europe and China are outpacing the U.S. in clean energy because their governments are offering incentives. Many smaller U.S. clean energy companies, he said, find it difficult to find private investors.Nonetheless, environmentalists say they're worried about other clean energy issues. The State Department is poised to decide later this year whether to approve a permit for a Canadian company to build a new oil pipeline from Alberta, Canada, to Texas, which supporters say will increase jobs and energy independence.In a move last month that angered much of the environmental community, Obama decided to delay implementing EPA rules limiting smog from vehicles, power plants and factories. Business leaders applauded the decision, saying the rules would have killed jobs.Poll: Alternative energy trumps fossil fuelSo, what do Americans think? Most (63%) say developing alternative energy sources should be a higher priority than expanding fossil fuel exploration and production,. For so-called \"main street Republicans,\" that number is 66%.Less than half (48%) of all Americans believe global warming is a proven fact caused mostly by cars, power plants and factories,. For self-described independent voters, that number is 38%.\"There's really no evidence at all that most people see a conflict between environmental protection and job creation in fact in many ways they see them going hand in hand,\" said Democratic pollster Mark Mellman.As for Election Day politics, Obama is unlikely to lose many votes over his environmental record, Mellman says, because most environmentalists will find themselves with few acceptable alternatives.nclude candidates who doubt that climate change is real and who favor eliminating the EPA.
